      I am a wonderful person.
      
      On Tuesdays, when I'm not busy saving the world, I walk my neighbor's
      dog. Occasionally I am involved in subterranean baseball, and enjoy
      candlelit dinners with me, myself, and I. I have met Michelangelo, and
      though he's alright, I could do a decidedly better job.
